# Online Movie Database Management System
Designed and implemented an online movie database management system as a self-assigned project during high school. Developed entity-relationship (ER) diagrams, designed relational tables, and implemented SQL queries to create a comprehensive and functional database. The project showcased my proficiency in database management, SQL, and attention to detail. Additionally, I demonstrated problem-solving skills by addressing challenges encountered during the project. This initiative highlighted my ability to independently conceptualize, plan, and execute a project from inception to completion, showcasing creativity and a commitment to quality work.
